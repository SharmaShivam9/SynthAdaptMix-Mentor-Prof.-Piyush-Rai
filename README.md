# SynthAdaptMix-Mentor-Prof.-Piyush-Rai
Traditional ML trains once on fixed data, assuming it won’t change. But real-world data shifts. We tackle this using domain adaptation and continual learning—blending synthetic data, augmentation, and prototype-based classification to help models adapt and generalize in real-time to new domains.
